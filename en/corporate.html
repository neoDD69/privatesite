                            <p>A straightforward premise…<br><br>

All companies are made of people and thus, at different stages of their evolution, most companies encounter the same problems. The issues most commonly felt by people at all levels within a company include: communication problems, especially between different departments, accompanied by dislikes and conflicts; low engagement/sense of belonging and poor motivation; and a low propensity for "genuine collaboration." In short, phrases like "The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing," "Everyone just looks out for their own backyard," "They make us do pointless things..." are widespread, and what is striking is that these sentiments are shared both at the managerial level and the operational level.<br>
<br>
Currently, four distinct generations are coexisting within companies (Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, Generation Z), making it challenging to create a work environment where everyone feels comfortable and can work together. Understanding what people of different ages think and want is crucial for the company to progress and achieve its goals.<br>
<br>
Therefore, companies have always been engaged in preventing and addressing these related issues. There are generally three approaches, which are compatible with each other, to generate the right culture, apply best practices, and build a serene working environment:<br>
</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
                <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    
                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                          

<ol class="list-num-wrap list-num-wrap-blu" start="1">
                                    <li style="line-height: 28px;"><strong>Consulting:</strong> Of various origins and natures, consulting helps define processes, timelines, and methods to operate more efficiently and effectively. This approach works, but it is not always positively received by those working within the company who may feel forced into actions not aligned with their preferences. Experience teaches us that people often seek shortcuts, thinking, "It's written this way, but we do it this other way because it's quicker, it's better..."
</li>
                                    <li style="line-height: 28px;"><strong>Training:</strong> On every kind of topic and nuance, training is always important because it inspires and allows for growth by acquiring new tools. It has a positive impact on the company, but the percentage of content that transitions from theory to practice is unfortunately always very low. Therefore, it's necessary to patiently invest many hours of people's time to see results. <br>
                                        A variant of training is Team Building—an experience always of great value, but then the adventure on the boat, in the mountains, or in the kitchen ends, and people return to daily reality often with the same dynamics as before!

</li>
                                    <li style="line-height: 28px;"><strong>Coaching:</strong> Very trendy in the last decade, coaching has an excellent impact because it aims to empower the individual (or small team) by guiding them to find their answers, thereby developing their way of thinking and reflecting on relationships with others and the impact of their actions. However, without a coach, all this cannot be successfully realized, which is why coaching skills are increasingly demanded of managers and are highly popular on resumes. Additionally, empowering the individual is always wonderful, but when that individual leaves the organization, it is necessary to start over from scratch!

                              <p>I turned to Private Community for a problem in our business. The comparison that comes to mind is very simple: it's like a physical therapist who helped me in my youth with a knee problem. After two months dedicated to my back and posture, only then did we start working on the knee. We did a similar job, working on ourselves as individuals and as entrepreneurs. Only after that did we tackle the core problem, but we approached it with a whole new awareness and consequently achieved excellent results. Having solved the problem, we continued the journey, delving into every department of our business. I can say that the investment was one of the best decisions of my entrepreneurial career.</p>

                              <p>I must say that the experience with Marco Grandinetti, a consultant from Private Community, was truly surprising. His ability to lead a Degano work team is noteworthy. He succeeded in bringing together a group of extremely positive and motivating individuals. During difficult times, when everything seemed to be going wrong, the team always managed to lift their spirits and restart with renewed enthusiasm. Marco demonstrated not only high-level professional skills but also an extraordinary ability to manage interpersonal relationships and maintain a positive and productive atmosphere. It was truly a pleasure working with him, and I look forward to collaborating again in the future</p>
